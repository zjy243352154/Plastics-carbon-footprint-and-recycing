This repository contains code associated with the paper "Towards Carbon-Neutral Plastics: The Role of Power-to-Plastics and Recycling." The repository includes:

Material Flow and Carbon Footprint Calculation: MATLAB scripts for calculating the material flows and carbon footprints of plastics in China, found in material_flow_carbon_footprint.m.

Techno-Economic Analysis: Excel files evaluating the economic feasibility of different plastic production pathways, including power-to-plastics.

Optimization: Python scripts and data for the MESSAGEix model to optimize plastic production technology pathways in China. To run these scripts, the MESSAGEix package (developed by IIASA) must be installed. After installation, the code can be executed in Python 3 using input data found in the Data for Optimization folder.

Each section is designed to support the paper's analyses, enabling reproducibility of results.
